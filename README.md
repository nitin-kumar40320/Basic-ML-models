# Basic-ML-models
This repository is a place to store my first uses of some common ML models. The dataset used to train them are either self generated or taken from publically avaliable sources.

Some of these models I have implemented from the basic, while for some I was more interested in experimenting with them and so have used sklearn or other library implementations.

Datasets for almost all of them have been loaded in csv format.
