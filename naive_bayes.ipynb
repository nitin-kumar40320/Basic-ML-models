I have no clue about ffs but... In the 2.4 kernel source Documentation/Configure.help there are various kernel options CONFIG_JFF* that enable it. http://developer.axis.com/software/jffs/ and http://sources.redhat.com/jffs2/ are the URLs cited in that documentation. They have links to mailing lists and archives which may be able to answer more specific questions.

(Not there yet in Mozilla and therefore not in the new mail engine I presume?) Netscape Messenger/Mozilla have LDAP LDIF import/export, but I can\\'t find vCard or a reference to it anywhere. I like the Netscape/Mozilla email client. I avoid LookOut for at least two reasons: Windows Only (my main environment is Linux with 30% on Windows) and security issues. Now that LDAP, and the related DSML and DNS SRV record methods, are becoming more popular, is there a decline of vCard? Is there a standard emerging to deal with the mismatch in naming between the two? I\\'ve brushed with directories in the past, but I\\'m getting in deep along with more PKI oriented focus. Any wisdom would be appreciated. In particular, I\\'m going to start integrating smart cards into my linux and Win32 systems and integrating them with Netscape Messenger/Mozilla and Outlook.

I started coding with C, then C, andnmoved on to Java... And, I think thatnnLooks like a case of MY experience is comprehensive, YOURS isnanecdotal, THEY dont know what theyre talking about.nnn1.  The people who pay the wages dont give a flyin heck what programmingnlanguage you write things in... they just want it to work.nnIn my experience, they do care.  It has to work certainly, and innparticular it has to work with what theyve already got, and it has tonwork on clients systems.nnMy limited experience of Java started a few years ago when support onnLinux was so terrible that I ran away screaming and havent come back yet.nnMicrosoft has announced that they plan to remove Java from Windows.nThey took it out of XP already and it has to be installed with anservice pack.  Somehow, I cant imagine them removing the ability tonrun C programs.nnn2.  C and C forces the developer to solve problems such as memorynmanagement over and over again.nnCant say I spend any noticeable amount of time on memory managementnissues, apart from the fact that I frequently need  4 GB.nnnIts about design patterns, architecture, high level stuff...nnIf your problem just requires application of a design pattern to solve,nthen its trivial anyway irrespective of language.nnnI am amazed by the amount of time wasted by people talking about lownlevel problems that have been solved 10 million times over and overnand over again...nnYou appear to be gratuitously asserting that C programmers waste timenon irrelevant lowlevel problems and Java programmers dont.  Dependsnentirely on the programmer, not the language.nnn3.  Java is not just a programming language Its also a platform...nnBuzzword.nnna monolithic set of APIs or a crap load of different APIs slicingnand dicing the same problems 50 different waysnnUnsupported assertion.nnn4.  If you have a program of any type of high complexity written in C, youncant possibly think that you could port it to different platforms withinnthe same magnitude of cost as Java....nnDunno.  E.g., I ported a wee 15000line C program to Darwin on PowerPCnin a few minutes yesterday.  Sure if it was badly designed it would ben10 times the size and harder to port.  If it depended on unavailablenlibraries it would be much harder.  Portable code is easy to port.nAt least that is the case when then language you used is available onnthe target platform I also run on ARM systems with no proper Java.nnn5.  Makes no sense for a scientific or a business project to depend on anperson... Java, IMHO, reduces the dependence of these entities on thenindividual developer as it is much easier to reverse engineer Java as it isnto reverse engineer C large applications.nnYou can pay a good programmer to solve your problem now, or else getnsome kids to hack spaghetti Fortran in any language and then pay fornmaintenance headaches ad infinitum.nn n6.  Hardware is getting so fast that Im not sure if the performancendifference between Java and CC are relevant any more.nnWhoah  Performance matters to me every day.  Right now Im takingntime out to write email while waiting for a job to run.  Sure I couldnwait 5 years until everyones PC is fast enough to generate random ECsnin no time, when any twit will be able to program inefficient codenthat is fast enough and the market will be overrun by competitors,nor I can do it now when very few people can.nn nThe end goal is the scientific or business problem to be solved.nnYes.nnnAnd for those problems, languages such as Java, SmallTalk, and othersnallow you to think more high level than low level.  Thinking of bitsnand bytes takes too much gray matter away from the real importantnproblems....nnIts true  I admit everything  Mea maxima culpa  Working in C makesnme spend all day thinking base, rank thoughts about hardcore bitographynNot.nnActually I spend most of my time thinking in highlevel mathematics.nnnWhy do most computer scientists insist on solving the same problemsnover and over again ...nnDunno, and frankly I dont see the relevance to the issue at hand.nnnIm sure Java is fine for some stuff, as is C or whatever.

Sigma Designs 1 is ancompany  looking to put out hardware to playback, amongst other things,ndivx files. Problem is Sigma is using XviDs gpled code in ways not veryngpl. The  results....XviD stops work on thier code and ask the users tonput preasure  on Sigma to honor the GPL.nnSome notes from other places....nnFrom Doom9 3nXviD development has been stopped The Sigma Designs REALMagic MPEG4nVideo Codec contains wide portions of code taken from the XviD project.nSoon after the initial release of the REALMagic codec the XviD developersnhave contacted Sigma and informed them about the GPL violation for thosenwho dont know, XviD is distributed under the GNU Public License  GPL nwhich demands that if you modify a GPL program you have to release itnunder the GPL, which in this case means that the source code of the Sigmancodec must be freely available. Sigma promised to replace the stolenncode, but the new version of the codec which was released this month onlyndisguises the stolen code, it was not actually removed. Sigma was oncenagain contacted and asked to remove the offending code but until todaynnothing has happened. Therefore the XviD team is now turning to the publicnin the hope to receive wide public support in their efforts to convincenSigma Designs to respect the terms of the GPL. And until the matter hasnbeen resolved XviD development will not continue.nnThat being said I hope all the forum members who saw their threads aboutnthe Sigma Codecs being closed will understand our motivation now.nInternally we already knew what was going on but since the XviD authorsnfirst wanted to try and resolve this internally we respected their wishesnand kept quiet about the matter at hand.nnUpdate Sigma has issued a press release announcing the availability ofnthe source code of their MPEG4 codec and its already up for download.nHowever, not a word was lost about the XviD issue and the press releasenmakes one think that the Sigma codec was entirely developed by Sigma so wenmight be hearing more about this.nnUpdate I found a GPL notice in some of the source code files, but itnalso looks like Sigma placed their own copyright lines there and XviDndoesnt get any credit in the source either. The GPL notice also collidesnwith Sigmas Software Licensing Agreement that you have to sign beforendownloading codec or source. On on the same issue DivXNetworks said theydnfully support XviD in this issue and apparently DXns relationship withnSigma didnt really work out either, as Sigmas Xcard is not as DivXncompatible as it was advertised.nnUpdateFirst an update on the XviD situation. The release of the Sigmansource code does not mean its all over, its far from being over. Thenlicense agreement which you have to agree to before you can download, andninstall the codec is not compatible with the GPL. Furthermore, it can nownclearly be seen download the source code and have a look for yourselfnthat the Sigma codec is pretty much a copy of the XviD codec, but all thencopyright notices of the original developers have been removed andnreplaced. This does not only violate the GPL but copyright laws  youncant just take a program, change a few lines and change the copyrightnstatements, you only have copyright protection for the parts you wrote onnyour own. And related to this the Sigma codec also contains code takennfrom the OpenDivX project, the files were outfitted with 2 differentncopyright notices which is quite funny.nnnn1 httpwww.xvid.orgn2 httpwww.sigmadesigns.comn3 httpwww.doom9.orgnnhttpxent.commailmanlistinfofork', 'Email marketing works  Theres no way around it.nNo other medium lets you share your offer with more npeople for less than the cost of a small classified ad.nnGet access to our targeted email list exchange where nour members can exchange their old targeted email lists for new ones.nnGet access to over 1 million fresh general emails every week.nnWe offer all the services above for free.nnnnBuyers are out there, marketing is the key.nSignup today at http68.62.73.31nLimited membershipnnThis is a one time message, you will not be emailed again.', 'An apparent quote from Dubya, from the Times sent to me by my Dadnnhttpwww.timesonline.co.ukprintFriendly0,,143351083,00.htmlnnnTONY BLAIRs special relationship with George W.

No exceptionsnnNAME', 'from httpwww.arstechnica.comnnThere has mostly been talk thus far and little action, but the Departmentnof Justice says it may be ready to file criminal lawsuits againstnindividuals 1 who distribute or receive unauthorized copyrightednmaterial over the Internet. Deputy Assistant Attorney General John Malcolm believesnthat criminal prosecutions of copyright offenders are now necessary tonpreserve the viability of Americas content industries. Malcolm alsonbelieves that people who trade copyrighted material think they arenparticipating in a legal activity. I certainly think people who downloadncopyrighted works understand that such distributionbarring provisionsnsuch as fair useis not authorized, and it is not surprising to seenbusinesses continue to look for means to discourage distribution ofncopyrighted works.nnnSome prosecutions that make that clear could be very helpful...I thinknthey would think twice if they thought there was a risk of criminalnprosecution, said RIAA President Cary Sherman, who was on the samenconference panel.nnIm not too confident that lawsuits would have the effect Sherman isnhoping for. Although infrequent, there have already been civil suits ornwarnings issued to private individuals, and they have served as minorndeterrents to the filesharing community at large. Criminal lawsuitsncarrying with them the possibility of prison sentences may generatenfurther animosity against groups such as the RIAA and may be difficult toninitiate because of the schooling effect of millions of systemsnparticipating in file sharing. Only servers would seem to stand out fromnthe crowd.nnThe article cites the No Electronic Theft NET Act 2, which definesnillegal  activity and maximum penalties for copyright infringementnnnCriminal infringement Any person who infringes a copyright willfully fornpurposes of commercial advantage or private financial gain, or by thenreproduction or distribution, including by electronic means, during anyn180day period, of 1 or more copies or phonorecords of 1 or morencopyrighted works, which have a total retail value of more than 1,000....nFor purposes of this subsection, evidence of reproduction or distributionnof a copyrighted work, by itself, shall not be sufficient to establishnwillful infringement.n...nThe term financial gain includes receipt, or expectation of receipt, ofnanything of value, including the receipt of other copyrighted works.nnnTherefore, receipt of a work of value would be defined as financial gainneven if no money is involved. The NET Act excerpt does not clarify how thenvalue of a work is determined an album or movie could be worth only 15nto millions of dollars depending on whether the value is assessed from thenperspective of the consumer or copyright holder.nnThe statute of limitationsnnn507. Limitations on actionsnna Criminal Proceedings.No criminal proceeding shall be maintainednunder the provisions of this title unless it is commenced within fivenyears after the cause of action arose.nnb Civil Actions.No civil action shall be maintained under thenprovisions of this title unless it is commenced within three years afternthe claim accrued.nnThe penalties are too extensive to list here, but they can be found innSection 2319 Criminal infringement of a copyright. In general, firsttimencriminal offenses will carry a maximum prison sentence of 1 year.nnIm still not sure where the DOJ would start in choosing people tonprosecute because of the aforementioned schooling effect, but my guessnwould be that, just like speeding, primarily the most prominentnindividuals who operate large servers or transfer the most data will bentargeted in order to discourage more recreational file sharers.

The Linux distributor runs an educationalnchannel to reach this audience, bundling educational softwarenwith its operating environment and offering networked supportnservices to eligible applicants.  This scheme was originally designednto suit the educational structures in the US, but is now available tonschools and universities throughout the world.nnRed Hat Linux 7.3 incorporates ease of use and maintenancenfeatures and is intended to counter objections that Linux is hard tonmaster on personal systems.nnThe Linuxforall project at UCC could also raise the profile of RednHat Ireland.

Bush proclaimed, The problem withnthe French is that they dont have a word for entrepreneur.nnStatus   False.nnOrigins   Yet another French fried George W.

According to scuttlebutt thatnemerged in the British press in July 2002, President Bush,nBritains Prime Minister Tony Blair, and Frances PresidentnJacques Chirac were discussing economics and, in particular,nthe decline of the French economy. The problem with thenFrench, Bush afterwards confided in Blair, is that they dontnhave a word for entrepreneur.nnThe source was Shirley Williams, also known as the BaronessnWilliams of Crosby, who claimed my good friend Tony Blair hadnrecently regaled her with this anecdote in Brighton.nnLloyd Grove of The Washington Post was unable to reach BaronessnWilliams to gain her confirmation of the tale, but he didnreceive a call from Alastair Campbell, Blairs director ofncommunications and strategy. I can tell you that the primenminister never heard George Bush say that, and he certainlynnever told Shirley Williams that President Bush did say it,nCampbell told The Post. If she put this in a speech, it mustnhave been a joke.nnThis is far from the first time Bush has been made the butt ofna jibe meant to showcase what some perceive as his less thannstellar intellectual abilities. Without straining our memoriesntoo hard, we can come up with three other instances wevenchronicled on this site. In the summer of 2001, the joke of thenmoment centered upon a supposed study that had resulted in thenranking of Presidential IQs, with George W. Bush being peggednas the Chief Executive who scraped the bottom of thenintelligence barrel. In December 2000 it was a fake Nostradamusnquatrain which pontificated that the village idiot would winnthe 2000 Presidential election. And in the spring of 2002, itnwas the story of Bushs waving at Stevie Wonder that set folksnto chortling up their sleeves.nnStories that illustrate this widely believed intellectualnshortcoming will always waft after George W. Bush because theynseemingly confirm what many already hold as true about thisnpublic figure, that hes not the brightest fellow thats evernbeen.

His mother was cleaning nand putting laundry away when she came across a large nbrown paper bag that was suspiciously buried beneath nsome clothes and a skateboard in the back of her n15yearold sons closet. nNothing could have prepared her for the shock she got nwhen she opened the bag and found it was full of cash. nFivedollar bills, twenties, fifties and hundreds  nall neatly rubberbanded in labeled piles. nMy first thought was that he had robbed a bank, nsays the 41yearold woman, There was over 71,000 ndollars in that bag  thats more than my husband nearns in a year. nThe woman immediately called her husband at the ncardealership where he worked to tell him what she nhad discovered. He came home right away and they ndrove together to the boys school and picked him up. nLittle did they suspect that where the money came from nwas more shocking than actually finding it in nthe closet. nAs it turns out, the boy had been sending out, via nEmail, a type of Report to Email addresses that he nobtained off the Internet. Everyday after school for nthe past 2 months, he had been doing this right on his ncomputer in his bedroom. nI just got the Email one day and I figured what the nheck, I put my name on it like the instructions said nand I started sending it out, says the clever n15yearold. nThe Email letter listed 5 addresses and contained ninstructions to send one 5 dollar bill to each person non the list, then delete the address at the top and nmove the others addresses down, and finally to add nyour name to the top of the list. nThe letter goes on to state that you would receive nseveral thousand dollars in fivedollar bills within 2 nweeks if you sent out the letter with your nname at the top of the 5address list. I get junk nEmail all the time, and really did not think it was ngoing to work, the boy continues. nWithin the first few days of sending out the Email, nthe Post Office Box that his parents had gotten him nfor his videogame magazine subscriptions began to nfill up with not magazines, but envelopes containing n5 bills. nAbout a week later I rode my bike down to the post noffice and my box had 1 magazine and about 300 nenvelops stuffed in it. There was also a yellow slip nthat said I had to go up to the post office counter. nI thought I was in trouble or something laughs. He ngoes on, I went up to the counter and they had a nwhole box of more mail for me. I had to ride back nhome and empty out my backpack because I could not ncarry it all. nOver the next few weeks, the boy continued sending nout the Email. The money just kept coming in and I njust kept sorting it and stashing it in the closet, nbarely had time for my homework. He had also nbeen riding his bike to several of the banks in his narea and exchanging the 5 bills for twenties, fifties nand hundreds. nI didnt want the banks to get suspicious so I kept nriding to different banks with like five thousand at a ntime in my backpack. I would usually tell the lady at nthe bank counter that my dad had sent me in to nexchange the money and he was outside waiting for me. nOne time the lady gave me a really strange look and ntold me that she would not be able to do it for me and nmy dad would have to come in and do it, but I just nrode to the next bank down the street laughs. nSurprisingly, the boy did not have any reason to be nafraid. The reporting news team examined and ninvestigated the socalled chainletter the boy was nsending out and found that it was not a chainletter nat all. In fact, it was completely legal according to nUS Postal and Lottery Laws, Title 18, Section 1302 and n1341, or Title 18, Section 3005 in the US code, also nin the code of federal regulations, Volume 16, nSections 255 and 436, which state a product or service nmust be exchanged for money received. nEvery fivedollar bill that he received contained a nlittle note that read, Please send me report number nXYX.This simple note made the letter legal because he nwas exchanging a service A Report on howto for a nfivedollar fee. nThis is the end of the media release. If you would nlike to understand how the system works and get your n71,000  please continue reading.

To my astonishment, I received ntotal n610,470.00 in 21 weeks, with money still coming in. nPam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey. nnHere is nanother testimonial  this program has been around for a nlong time but I never believed in it. But one day when I received this nagain in the mail I decided to gamble my 25 on it. I followed the nsimple instructions and wallaa ..... 3 weeks later the money started to ncome nin. First month I only made 240.00 but the next 2 months after that nmade a total of 290,000.00.

To assist nyou with marketing your business on the internet, the 5 reports you npurchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which nincludes how to send bulk emails legally, where to find thousands of nfree nclassified ads and much more. There are 2 Primary methods to get this nventure going nMETHOD  1 BY SENDING BULK EMAIL LEGALLY nn nLets say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and nwe will assume You and those involved send out only 5,000 emails each. nLets also assume that the mailing receive only a 0.2 response the nresponse ncould be much better but lets just say it is only 0.2. Also many npeople will send out hundreds of thousands emails instead of only 5,000 neach.Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 emails. nWith a 0.2 response, that is only 10 orders for report  1 nThose 10 people responded by sending out 5,000 email each for a total nof 50,000. nOut of those 50,000 emails only 0.2 responded with orders. Thats100 npeople responded and ordered Report  2. nThose 100 people mail out 5,000 emails each for a total of 500,000 nemails. The 0.2 response to that is 1000 orders for Report  3. nThose 1000 people send out 5,000 emails each for a total of 5 nmillion emails sent out. The 0.2 response to that is 10,000 orders nfor Report  4. Whose 10,000 people send out 5,000 emails each for a ntotal of n50,000,000 50 million emails. The 0.2 response to that is 100,000 norders for nReport  5 THATS 100,000 ORDERS TIMES 5 EACH500,000.00 half nmillion. nYour total income in this example is 1..... 50  2..... 500 n 3.....5,000  4..... 50,000  5..... 500,000 ........ Grand nTotal555,550.00 nNUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL  PAPER AND FIGURE OUT THE nWORST POSSIBLERESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU nCALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL nMAKE A LOT OF MONEY  nn nREMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE ORDERING nOUT nOF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think for a moment what would happen if neveryone or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000emails neach or more There are over 150 million people on the Internet worldwide nand counting. Believe me, many people will do just that, and more nMETHOD  2  BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET nn nAdvertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are nhundreds of FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the nInternet will easily get a larger response. We strongly suggest you nstart with Method  1and add METHOD  2 as you go along. For every 5 you nreceive, all you must do is email them the Report they ordered. Thats nit. Always provide nsame day service on all orders. nThis will guarantee that the email they send out, with your nname and address on it, will be prompt because they can not advertise nuntil they receive the report. nAVAILABLE REPORTS n nORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER  NAME ONLY. Notes Always nsend n5 cash U.S. CURRENCY for each Report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure nthe cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper. On none of those sheets of paper, Write the NUMBER  the NAME of the Report you nare ordering, nYOUR EMAIL ADDRESS and your name and postal address. nPLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE REPORTS NOW  nn nREPORT 1 The Insiders Guide to Advertising for Free on the Net nOrder Report 1 from nK.Palludan n9550 Summersweet Ct. nLas Vegas, Nevada 89123 nUSA', 'On Fri, 23 Aug 2002, Tom wrotenn from httpwww.arstechnica.comnn There has mostly been talk thus far and little action, but then Department of Justice says it may be ready to file criminal lawsuitsn against individuals 1 who distribute or receive unauthorizedn copyrighted material over the Internet.nnAnd yet STILL noone is out there creating public domain content.

You most likely havenjust seen this story recently featured on a major nightly news program USA.nAnd reported elsewhere in the world including my neck of the woods nNew Zealand.

Nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got whennshe opened the bag and found it was full of cash. Fivedollar bills, twenties,nfifties and hundreds  all neatly rubberbanded in labelled piles.nnMy first thought was that he had robbed a bank, says the 41yearoldnwoman, There was over 71,000 dollars in that bag thats more than mynhusband earns in a year.nnThe woman immediately called her husband at the cardealership wherenhe worked to tell him what she had discovered.He came home right awaynand they drove together to the boys school and picked him up.  Little didnthey suspect that where the money came from was more shocking thannactually finding it in the closet.nnAs it turns out, the boy had been sending out, via Email, a type of nReport to Email addresses that he obtained off the Internet. Everydaynafter school for the past 2 months, he had been doing this right on hisncomputer in his bedroom.nnI just got the Email one day and I figured what the heck, I put my namenon it like the instructions said and I started sending it out, says the clevern15yearold.nnThe Email letter listed 5 addresses and contained instructions to send onen5 dollar bill to each person on the list, then delete the address at the topnand move the others addresses Down , and finally to add your name tonthe top of the list.nnThe letter goes on to state that you would receive several thousandndollars in fivedollar bills within 2 weeks if you sent out the letter with yournname at the top of the 5address list. I get junk Email all the time, andnreally did not think it was going to work, the boy continues.nnWithin the first few days of sending out the Email, the Post Office Boxnthat his parents had gotten him for his videogame magazine subscriptionsnbegan to fill up with not magazines, but envelopes containing 5 bills.nnAbout a week later I rode my bike down to the post office and my boxnhad 1 magazine and about 300 envelops stuffed in it. There was also anyellow slip that said I had to go up to the post office counter. I thought Inwas in trouble or something laughs. He goes on, I went up to thencounter and they had a whole box of more mail for me. I had to ride backnhome and empty out my backpack because I could not carry it all.  Overnthe next few weeks, the boy continued sending out the Email.  Thenmoney just kept coming in and I just kept sorting it and stashing it in thencloset, barely had time for my homework.He had also been riding his bikento several of the banks in his area and exchanging the 5 bills for twenties, nfifties and hundreds.nnI didnt want the banks to get suspicious so I kept riding to different banksnwith like five thousand at a time in my backpack. I would usually tell thenlady at the bank counter that my dad had sent me in to exchange thenmoney and he was outside waiting for me.One time the lady gave me anreally strange look and told me that she would not be able to do it for menand my dad would have to come in and do it, but I just rode to the nextnbank down the street laughs.  Surprisingly, the boy did not have anynreason to be afraid.The reporting news nnteam examined and investigated the socalled chainletter the boy wasnsending out and found that it was not a chainletter at all.In fact, it wasncompletely legal according to US Postal and Lottery Laws, Title 18,nSection 1302 and 1341, or Title 18, Section 3005 in the US code, also innthe code of federal regulations, Volume 16, Sections 255 and 436, whichnstate a product or service must be exchanged for money received.nnEvery fivedollar bill that he received contained a little note that read,nPlease send me report number XYX.This simple note made the letternlegal because he was exchanging a service A Report on howto for a nfivedollar fee.nnThis is the end of the media release.

This is the letter you have beennhearing about on the news lately. Due to the popularity of this letter on then Internet, a national weekly news program recently devoted an entirenshow to the investigation of this program described below, to see if it reallyncan make people money. The show also investigated whether or not thenprogram was legal. Their findings proved once and for all that there arenabsolutely NO Laws prohibiting the participation in the program and ifnpeople can follow the simple instructions, they are bound to make somenmegabucks with only 25 out of pocket cost.nnnDUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY  RESPECT THISnPROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTERnTHAN EVER.nnnNote follow the directons below, I had best results the second time whennI hired a bulk email service in addition to following the reports instructions.nnIn order for all of us to be successful, many, many emails must be sent sonthat the returns are many. I have been extremely successful using thenfollowing company. They send out the offers, and all I do is accept moneynfor reports, then I send back to the people as soon as possible.nnThis is what one had to say Thanks to this profitable opportunity. I was napproached many times before but each time I passed on it. I am so glad Infinally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimalneffort and money required. To my astonishment, I received totaln610,470.00 in 21 weeks, with money still coming in.nnPam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey.nnnHere is another testimonial This program has been around for a long time nbut I never believed in it. But one day when I received this again in thenmail I decided to gamble my 25 on it. I followed the simple instructionsnand walaa ..... 3 weeks later the money started to come in. First month Inonly made 240.00 but the next 2 months after that I made a total ofn290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months by reentering the program, Inhave made over 710,000.00 and I am playing it again.

To assist you with marketingnyour business on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will provide younwith invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulknemails legally, where to find thousands of free classified ads and muchnmore. There are 2 Primary methods to get this venture goingnnnMETHOD 1 BY SENDING BULK EMAIL LEGALLYnnnnLets say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we willnassume You and those involved send out only 5,000emails each. Letsnalso assume that the mailing receive only a 0.2 response the responsencould be much better but lets just say it is only 0.2. Also many peoplenwill send out hundreds of thousands emails instead of only 5,000 each.nContinuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 emails.nnnWith a 0.2 response, that is only 10 orders for report  1. Those 10npeople responded by sending out 5,000 email each for a total of 50,000.nOut of those 50,000 emails only 0.2 responded with orders. That equalsn100 people responded and ordered Report  2.nnThose 100 people mail out 5,000 emails each for a total of 500,000 emails.nThe 0.2 response to that is 1000 orders for Report 3.nnThose 1000 people send out 5,000 emails each for a total of 5 millionnemails sent out. The 0.2 response to that is 10,000 orders for Report 4.nnThose 10,000 people send out 5,000 emails each for a total ofn50,000,000 50 million emails. The 0.2 response to that is 100,000norders for Report 5. THATS 100,000 ORDERS TIMESn5 EACH500,000.00 half million. Your total income in this example isn1..... 50 2.....500  3.....5,000  4..... 50,000  5..... 500,000.......nGrand Total555,550.00nnnNUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL  PAPER AND FIGURE OUTnTHE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOUnCALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEYnnnREMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLEnORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think for a momentnwhat would happen if everyone or half or even one 4th of those peoplenmailed 100,000emails each or more There are over 150 million people on nthe Internet worldwide and counting. Believe me, many people will do justnthat, and morennnMETHOD 2 BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNETnnAdvertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are hundreds ofnFREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the Internet willneasily get a larger response.nnnWe strongly suggest you start with Method 1 and add METHOD 2 asnyou go along. For every 5 you receive, all you must do is email them thenReport they ordered. Thats it. Always provide same day service on allnorders. This will guarantee that the email they send out with your namenand address on it, will be prompt because they can not advertise until theynreceive the report.nnORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER  NAME ONLY. Notes Alwaysnsend 5 cash U.S. CURRENCY for each Report. Checks NOTnaccepted. Make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2nsheets of paper or aluminum foil.

However, due to this situation we decided to change most of my husbands billions of dollars deposited in Swiss bank and other countries into other forms of money coded for safe purpose because the new head of state of Dr Mr Laurent Kabila has made arrangement with the Swiss government and other European countries to freeze all my late husbands treasures deposited in some european countries. nnHence, my children and I decided laying low in Africa to study the situationntill when things gets better. Like now that president Kabila is dead and the son taking overnJoseph Kabila.

Bronson n the serial hostage taker, not the movie star  has written a health andn fitness guide in which he shares some of the secrets behind his legendaryn muscle power. n n Solitary Fitness  a title which bears testament to the fact that Bronson, 48,n has spent 24 of his 28 prison years in solitary confinement  explains how hen has turned himself into a lean, mean, fitness machine while living 23 hours an day in a space just 12 feet by eight feet, on a diet of scrubs grub and atn virtually no cost. n n The book is aimed at those who want to get fabulously fit without spending an fortune on gym memberships, protein supplements or designer trainers, andn starts with a fierce attack on some of the expensive myths churned out by then exercise industry. n n I pick up a fitness mag, I start to laugh and I wipe my arse with it, is then opening paragraph penned by Bronson. It’s a joke and a big con and they calln me a criminal You can’t help feeling he has a point. n n This is not the first book that Bronson has written from behind bars, havingn already published Birdman Opens His Mind, which features drawings and poemsn created by Bronson while in prison. And he is not the first prisoner ton discover creative expression while residing at Her Majesty’s pleasure. n n Jimmy Boyle, the Scots sculptor and novelist, discovered his artistic talentsn when he was sent to Barlinnie Prison’s famous special unit, which aimed ton help inmates put their violent pasts behind them by teaching them how ton express their emotions artistically. Boyle was sentenced to life for then murder of Babs Rooney in 1967. Once released, he moved to Edinburgh where hen has become a respected artist. His first novel, Hero of the Underworld, wasn published in 1999 and his autobiography, A Sense of Freedom, was made into ann awardwinning film. n n Hugh Collins was jailed for life in 1977 for the murder of William Mooney inn Glasgow, and in his first year in Barlinnie prison stabbed three prisonn officers, earning him an extra sevenyear sentence. But, after beingn transferred to the same unit that Boyle attended, he learned to sculpt andn developed an interest in art. He later published Autobiography of a Murderer,n a frank account of Glasgow’s criminal culture in the 1960s, which receivedn critical praise. n n And Lord Archer doesn’t seem to have had trouble continuing to write the booksn that have made him millions while in jail. He recently signed a threebookn deal with Macmillan publishers worth a reported £10 million, and is no doubtn scribbling away as we speak. n n So why is it that men like Collins, Bronson and Boyle, who can be son destructive towards society on the outside, can become so creative once stuckn on the inside Steve Richards, Bronson’s publisher, has published many booksn about criminal figures and believes the roots of this phenomenon are bothn pragmatic and profound. n n He says Prison is sometimes the first time some criminals will ever haven known a stable environment, and this can be the first time they have then chance to focus on their creative skills. n n It may also be the first time that they have really had the chance of ann education, if their early years have been hard. It could be the first timen anyone has offered them the chance to explore their creative talents. n n However, Richards believes the reasons are also deeper than that. He saysn Once they are behind bars, the cold light of day hits them, and they examinen the very essence of who they are. n n They ask themselves, am I a man who wants to be remembered for violence Orn am I a man who can contribute to society, who can be remembered for somethingn good n n Bronson  who was born Michael Gordon Peterson, but changed his name to thatn of the Hollywood star of the Death Wish films  has, so far, been rememberedn mainly for things bad. He was originally jailed for seven years for armedn robbery in 1974, and has had a series of sentences added to his original termn over the years as a result of attacking people in prison. In 2000 he wasn jailed for life after being convicted of holding a teacher hostage for nearlyn two days during a jail siege. n n Standing five feet ten and a half inches tall and weighing 210lbs, he isn renowned for his strength. He has bent metal cell doors with his bare handsn and does up to 3,000  yes, 3,000  pressups a day. As he puts it I can hitn a man 20 times in four seconds, I can push 132 press ups in 60 seconds. n n But judging by our current obsession with health and exercise, Solitaryn Fitness might be the book which will see Bronson’s face sitting on everyn coffee table in the land. He might be the man to give us the dream body whichn so many socalled fitness gurus promise but fail to motivate us into. Becausen Bronson has learned to use words as powerfully as he can use his fists. n n All this crap about highprotein drinks, pills, diets, it’s just a load ofn bollocks and a multimillionpound racket, he writes, in what can only ben described as a refreshingly honest style. We can all be fat lazy bastards,n it’s our choice, I’m sick of hearing and reading about excuses, if you stuffn your face with shit you become shit, that’s logical to me. n n As motivational mantras go, that might be just the kick up the, er, backsiden we all needed. n n n Solitary Fitness by Charles Bronson is published by Mirage Publishing and willn be available in bookstores from October at £7.99', ' From forkadminxent.com mailtoforkadminxent.com On Behalf OfnDaven Longn Sent Thursday, August 22, 2002 1112 AMn To forkexample.comn Subject RE The Curse of Indias Socialismn n n n When Id read that getting legal titlen can take 20 years, when I believe thatn 1 year ought to be more than sufficient,n and helped by the Cairo reference Idn assumed that we were talking about then urban poor.n n If I see people living in mansions, orn even in suburban subdivisions, I assumen they didnt have too much trouble withn their titles.nnPg 177nIn another country, a local newspaper, intrigued by our evidence ofnextralegal real estate holdings, checked to see if the head of statesnofficial residence had a recorded title.

I have urgent and very confidential business proposal for you. On June 6  1999 a FOREIGN Oil consultantcontractor with the FEDERAL MINISTRY OF AVIATIONMr. Barry Kelly made a numbered time Fixed Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US25,000,000.00 Twenty five Million Dollars in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his  employers, the FEDERAL MINISTRY OF AVIATION that Mr. Barry Kelly died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Barry Kelly did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank.This sum of US25,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one willever come forward to claim it.According to Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 6 six years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, i have just sucided in getting this fund sent to holland through a security company called GLOBAL BASIC FINANCIAL COMPANY., I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that i will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits, which will put you in place as the owner of this fund in the security company. i shall employ the service of an Attorney for drafting and notarization of the changes  and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate  administration in your favour. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and my position as the Brannch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please replyimmediately via the private email address . Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.nnAwaiting your urgent reply via my email nnThanks and regards. nnMR.IKE EJOH', 'Apols if this has been posted beforennhttpwww.pinkpaperclips.netsubsquiz2.htmlnnRob', 'On 23 Aug 2002 at 257, Robert Harley wrotenn Its an amusing anecdote, I dont know if its true or not,n but certainly nothing here supports the authoritativen sounding conclusion Status False.nnI actually thought it was pretty funny and quite accurate.
